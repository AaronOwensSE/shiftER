# Project Management Plan

## Stakeholders

### Developer

Concerns include fulfilling requirements, identifying implicit requirements, learning necessary skills, maintaining productivity, and guarding against scope creep. Not a user of the system.

### Product Owner

Main source of requirements and main promoter of the system to other users. Also a user of the system. Primary concern is a working product matching the desired requirements that can be shared to professional colleagues.

### Users

Working professionals primarily concerned with correct function, device compatibility, ease of use, and UI/UX.

## Methods

### Iterative, Incremental Development

Development will be responsive to changing requirements. Increments will be feature-focused and drawn primarily from the requirements table with due consideration for priority level. Improvement of existing features and integration of new features will be performed iteratively.

### Change Management

To organize requirements priority and control scope, a simple feature request website will be developed. Requests will go through an approval process. Approved requests will be translated to entries in the requirements table.
