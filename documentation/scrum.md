# Scrum

## Motivation

After approaching this project from several different angles, I have completed a large amount of work and learned a variety of new skills, but I feel as if I am not achieving the early and frequent delivery of value idealized in the Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto.

Although this is a solo project, I think adopting the Scrum framework is the correct path forward. I understand Scrum says that modified Scrum is not Scrum. Nonetheless, I think the closest possible adherence to this framework will help me separate roles (even if this is merely a shift of mindset), estimate work, identify obstacles, improve velocity, and reflect upon results.

## Product Backlog

The product backlog is informed by the requirements specification document, but items have been reconceptualized to fit the Scrum structure. On future projects, I may forego the requirements specification and commit to more direct development of the product backlog.

| Feature | Priority |
|----|----|
| Database Setup and Model API Completion | High |
| Frontend | High |
| Sign-Up, Login, and Authentication | High |
| Basic Group Functionality | High |
| Basic Draft and Schedule Functionality | High |
| Fine-Grained Profile Management | Medium |
| Fine-Grained Group Management | Medium |
| Fine-Grained Draft Management | Medium |
| Fine-Grained Schedule Management | Medium |
| Excel Integration | Low |
| Qgenda Integration | Low |

    - Partial Work on User-Centric Controllers
    - Jest Setup
    - Partial Model Testing

## Sprints

Sprints for this project will be 2 weeks in duration. A Fibonacci-based points system will be used during sprint planning to estimate backlog feature difficulty. A new GitHub branch will be used for each sprint.

I anticipate spending some time in each sprint as my own scrum master, clearing obstacles for myself. I expect most obstacles to take the form of external resource acquisition, like setting up a laptop so I can work remotely, or development of new skills, like taking a crash course in Express or Jest.
