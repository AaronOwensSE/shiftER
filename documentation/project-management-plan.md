# Project Management Plan

## Stakeholders

### Developer

Concerns include fulfilling requirements, identifying implicit requirements, learning necessary skills, maintaining productivity, and guarding against scope creep. Not a user of the system.

### Product Owner

Main source of requirements and main promoter of the system to other users. Also a user of the system. Primary concern is a working product matching the desired requirements that can be shared to professional colleagues.

### Users

Working professionals primarily concerned with correct function, device compatibility, ease of use, and UI/UX.

## Scrum Methodology

After some initial stages of research and development under a generic IID methodology, I have decided to reorganize this project under Scrum to improve focus and velocity. The original requirements specification document (still available as a detailed list of initial project goals) has been used to develop a Scrum product backlog. Going forward, the Scrum documentation will be the authoritative document on project activity.

## Challenges

Developer's (my) skillset is the primary bottleneck on this project. I last built web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL on a home server before the days of mobile apps. The landscape has changed since then, and I will be using this project as an opportunity to learn JSX, React, React Native, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Jest, Expo, and modern deployment platforms.

With respect to project functionality, the main areas of difficulty I will need to research include authentication, push notifications, portability, responsiveness, backend configuration, and deployment. Core functions must also be tested and ensured across multiple users without overburdening user stakeholders.

With the adoption of Scrum, I hope to treat skill shortages as specific obstacles to be cleared from sprint backlogs. My intention is that skill gaps will be addressed succinctly to enable specific product increments.
