# Project Management Plan

## Goal

This project will develop a full-stack app that enables groups of users to build shared work schedules using a serpentine draft for shift selection.

## Structure

This repo will serve as the project landing page and will link to sub-projects. The backend API and mobile frontend will be two separate sub-projects. A web frontend may also be added as a third. High-level documentation applicable to the entire project will be available here in the top-level repo, while documentation specific to sub-projects will be distributed to those sub-project repos.

## Methodology

Each sub-project will be built one at a time (backend first) using the Scrum methodology. Scrum artifacts will be kept with sub-project documentation and supplemented with a Lessons Learned document for both Scrum retrospectives and general development insights.

## Stakeholders

### Developer

I am the only developer on this project. My concerns include fulfilling requirements, identifying implicit requirements, acquiring new skills, maintaining productivity, and guarding against scope creep.

### Product Owner

The product owner is the main source of requirements and main promoter of the system to other users. They are also a user of the system. Their primary concern is a working product matching the desired requirements that can be shared to professional colleagues.

### Users

The users are working professionals primarily concerned with correct function, device compatibility, ease of use, and UI/UX.

## Challenges and Risks

The developer's (my) time and skillset are the primary drivers of this project. I am using this as an opportunity to learn and improve. Since I work a full-time job unrelated to software development, I will be completing this project during my free time. I hope Scrum will be an effective instrument for keeping me on task, but some weeks may have to yield to other life concerns. There are no significant business or financial risks involved in this project.

## Testing and Deployment

Testing and deployment will be performed continuously during Scrum sprints, not as separate phases of development.
