# Project Management Plan

## Stakeholders

### Developer

Concerns include fulfilling requirements, identifying implicit requirements, learning necessary skills, maintaining productivity, and guarding against scope creep. Not a user of the system.

### Product Owner

Main source of requirements and main promoter of the system to other users. Also a user of the system. Primary concern is a working product matching the desired requirements that can be shared to professional colleagues.

### Users

Working professionals primarily concerned with correct function, device compatibility, ease of use, and UI/UX.

## Methods

### Iterative, Incremental Development

Development will be focused on short-term increments and responsive to changing requirements. Increments will be feature-focused and drawn primarily from the requirements table with due consideration for priority level. Improvement of existing features and integration of new features will be performed iteratively.

### Change Management

To organize requirements priority and control scope, a simple feature request website will be developed. Requests will go through an approval process. Approved requests will be translated to entries in the requirements table.

## Challenges

Developer's (my) skillset is the primary bottleneck on this project. I last built web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL on a home server before the days of mobile apps. The landscape has changed since then, and I will be using this project as an opportunity to learn React, React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Expo, and modern deployment platforms. This will take time.

With respect to project functionality, the main areas of difficulty I will need to research include authentication, push notifications, portability, responsiveness, backend configuration, and deployment. Core functions must also be tested and ensured across multiple users without overburdening user stakeholders.

All of these challenges can be addressed with research, practice, and careful testing. Time is the main ingredient.
