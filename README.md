## Active Repos

This project has very recently undergone a major reset due to a desire for new architecture and stronger separation of concerns. These repos are building up from a fresh start, informed by old code but dedicated to a new approach. To explore prior work on the project, please visit the archived repo in the next section.

## Archived Repo: [shiftER-v1-archive](https://github.com/AaronOwensSE/shiftER-v1-archive)

Initial project version. Archived due to a major architectural rework.

Achieves end-to-end implementation of account creation, login credential authentication, session authentication, session rotation, secure credential storage, logout, and navigation. Contains scripted support for complete database schema setup and teardown, as well as database seeding. Also contains extensive but incomplete support for most anticipated features, including frontend screens and components and backend database models.

Test cases written in Jest approach 100% statement coverage of backend code, while all completed frontend features passed manual GUI and integration testing in Expo Go.

Documentation is also included detailing project management, Scrum, requirements, user stories, tools and technologies, architecture, frontend design, project structure and dependencies, and lessons learned.
